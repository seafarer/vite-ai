# Vite + React + TailwindCSS + Prettier

This is a template for React projects using Vite, TailwindCSS, and Prettier. It provides a minimal setup to create a simple React App using familiar tools.

No Typescript here, folks. Just plain old Javascript.

It also includes the setup to use [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) for UI components.
